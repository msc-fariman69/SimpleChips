A simple angular library includes two chips controls
> One day I was looking for a simple chips component to use in my project and what is better than starting to write my own then!?

## Input chips
- You can type a string value and press enter to add the item to chips. you can even add more than one item by splitting them using space.
- The control gives you items as a string array.
- The defined policy won't add the duplicate item.
- You can delete items by hovering and clicking on them.
- You can connect the control with form control to be a control in a form group with all form control features.
